<h1>Guide to your Cottage</h1>

<h2>Departure Time</h2>

<p>Departure time is 10.00am. We would be very grateful if you would adhere to
this time as this allows us time to prepare the cottage for the next guests.</p>

<h2>Clean Bed Linen and Towels</h2>

<p>Bed linen and towels is provided. We will provide fresh linen if you should
stay longer than one week.</p>

<h2>Heating</h2>

<p>The gas heating is on a timer and in the Winter months we usually set the
timer on from 6am to 11pm. The cottage is well insulated and the heat should be
sufficient, if however you are feeling to cold or hot we will be happy to
change the setting. Just let us know.</p>

<h2>Water Heating</h2>

<p>The water heating is on permanently, and the water will get hot soon after
you run the tap. We are currently monitoring the boiler and if there are any
issues, let us know.</p>

<h2>Waste Disposal</h2>

<p>The waste bins are located at the bottom of the drive just by the entrance
gate. The refuse collection day is on Monday and rubbish must be in large bin
liners provided, not little shopping bags. Please recycle your bottles at
facilities at the local supermarkets.</p>

<h2>Fire Extinguishers and Blankets</h2>

<p>There is a fire alarm in the hall area which you can reset if it should go
of accidentally. The fire blanket is next to the cooker. The fire extinguisher
is in the cupboard above the cooker on the right as well as a first aid
kit.</p>

<h2>Exploring</h2>

<p>Guests and their children are welcome to explore the surrounding fields and
stream, though children under 16 should always be accompanied by an adult. Dogs
must be kept on leads around livestock. Remember it is dangerous to be in the
same field as young cattle as they can easily knock you over.</p>

<h2>Outside Lights</h2>

<p>The light switch to the outside light by the entrance is the first switch on
the left as you enter the cottage. The switch for the patio light is behind the
TV.</p>

<h2>Fuse Box</h2>

<p>The fuse box is in the cupboard above the cooker to the right.</p>

<h2>Parking</h2>

<p>There is enough space for two cars to park by the cottage. Please make sure
That there is enough space for a tractor or car to pass. It is therefore best
to park close to the hedge.</p>

<h2>Pets</h2>

<p>1 small dog is welcome to Praze Cottage. Please keep your pet under control and
clear up after him.</p>

<p>Pets are not permitted in the bedrooms or on the furniture.</p>

<p>Please do not leave your pet in the cottage unsupervised as this can result in
considerable damage to the property and distress to the pet.</p>
