<h1>Finding the right fabric</h1>

Ultimately it takes many years of experience to know a good fabric from a bad
one. I can offer you my experience in choosing the right cloth for the job.
Please contact me for a consultation in Cornwall.

<ul>

<li>Natural fibres are best. Though qualities vary.</li>
<li>Thick linen or linen unions (sometimes an unnatural fibre can help) are best for loose covers.</li>
<li>It depends. For example it could be a fantastic fabric, with a bad print.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Curtains</h1>

<p>
I offer two different qualities of curtains.
</p>

<h2 id=hand-lined><span class=secno>1 </span>Hand Lined</h2>

<p>
Lining hand locked on seams, hand hemmed with weighted mitred corners and
slip-stitched sides. This produces a flexible curtain, in that the face fabric
and the lining are not held rigidly as in a machine-lined curtain.
</p>

<p>
Suitable for all types of heading.
</p>

<h2 id=interlined><span class=secno>2 </span>Interlined</h2>

<p> Here the interlining is locked to the face fabric and the lining is the
locked to the interlining to bond the three layers together while still
allowing movement.  </p>

<p> Interlining produces a much softer look to your curtains, round plump
folds, no creases.  </p>

<p> It is also a wonderful insulation and together with the lining, protects
the face fabric from light damage. All headings are offered.</p>

<p> I do encourage customers to choose interlined curtains because they are so
much better and there are many situations when interlining is neither wanted or
needed. The choice is yours.</p>

<h1>Roman Blinds</h1>

<p> Roman blinds provide a very smart solution to dressing windows. They suit
almost all window styles whether period or contemporary.  </p>

<p> They use a minimum of fabric (often the expensive part) and although they
are time-consuming to make, the result is cost-effective.  </p>

<p> The blinds are supplied complete with batten, cord, Velcro heading, dowels
cleat and acorn. The blind has no machine lines on the face side of the fabric,
this makes a softer looking blind.  Rings are hand sewn in place.  </p>

<p> For a plumper more luxurious look I recommend an interlined blind.  </p>

<h1>Pelmets</h1>

<p>I'm able to create customised pelmet boards of any shape or size.</p>

<p>Pelmets are a great way to hide poles.</p>
